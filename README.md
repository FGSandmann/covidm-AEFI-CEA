## Summary of project

This repository contains the code required to explore whether the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine may outweigh the harm from a wider societal perspective, taking into account mild disease, transmission and the economic impact of both adverse events and COVID-19. 

We extended a previously developed age-structured epidemiological-economic model of COVID-19 mass vaccination in the UK (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00079-7) to explore the impact of the adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) observed with the AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine. 

In a subsequent threshold analysis, we used a wide range of hypothetical combinations of rates and severities of AEFIs. 

We traded-off the risk of AEFIs in vaccinated individuals with the community-wide benefit of vaccination over ten years. 

All outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, the net health value (defined as the difference in QALYs and costs, with costs converted into QALYs at Â£20,000/QALY), and the benefit-risk ratio (of the vaccine over the harm from AEFIs).


## Overview of files

The main script of the analysis runs 3 vaccination scenarios, 3 physical distancing scenarios, and the threshold analysis of 7x14 scenarios of severity and risk of adverse events. On a current laptop (Core i7 2.8GHz CPU, 32GB RAM) this takes around 2-3 hours to run. The analysis requires covidM to be installed (originally developed by Nick Davies et al.). The version used here can be found in the folder "covidm_for_fitting". The file path in the main script will need to be updated to the directory of this project where it was saved.

The scripts contain the following:

- "0_AEFI-COVID19-vacc_main.R" : The main file of the analysis to run the simulations, plot visualisations, save results.

- "1_AEFI-COVID19-vacc_funs.R" : Custom-made functions for the analysis, including wrapper functions using covidM and the cost-effectiveness analysis.

- "2_AEFI-COVID19-vacc_dataUK.R" : Includes the required input data used for the UK; all open access and in the public domain.

- The file "nationallifetables3yearuk.xlsx" contains publicly available data of life tables for the UK from ONS (available from https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2017to2019 ; updated in September every year)
